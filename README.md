# Optional Skin Attachments

Optional Skin Attachments is now compatible with [Super Duper Skin Swapper](https://github.com/ncakes/PD2-Super-Duper-Skin-Swapper).

## Overview

This mod allows you to choose which attachments to use when applying weapon skins and provides improved support for legendary skins. Main features:

- **Choose Skin Attachments:** Replaces the apply/remove skin confirmation dialog with a menu that allows you to choose which attachments to use. Attachments that are part of the skin will show up as "Available" to use while the skin is applied (as is the case in the base game).
- **Customize Legendary Skins:** Allow first generation legendary skins to be fully customized. Legendary attachments will be shown in the weapon customization menu and can be used if the corresponding skin is equipped.
- **Enhanced Preview Options:** Option to enable dialog menus for choosing wear and weapon modifications in previews.
- **Default Color Settings:** Choose a default paint scheme, color wear, and pattern scale for weapon colors.

## Additional Changes/Remarks

- Fixes a bug in the base game where skins were not being sorted correctly.
- Fixes a bug in the base game where weapons could not be renamed even after the legendary skin was removed.
- Various fixes to prevent clipping/missing weapon parts when customizing legendary weapons.
- Allows attachments to be previewed on first generation legendary skins.
- Allows second generation legendary skins to be renamed.
- Displays a visual indicator when players use swapped skins.
